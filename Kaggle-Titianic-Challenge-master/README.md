# Kaggle-Titianic-Challenge
In this repo, I will demonstrate my work in Kaggle Challenge: Titanic. The official URL:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
This challenge focus on building basic knowledge skillset for data science, especially on feature engineering. I did lots of work on this part.
Also, the best result I could get is through K-Nearest-Neighbors Method. Sometimes. simple model can achieve great score. To understand this is pretty important.
